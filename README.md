 # University Network Simulation Project

Welcome to the University Network Simulation Project! This project aims to simulate a network system for a university using Cisco Packet Tracer software. The network includes various devices such as computers, printers, switches, routers, email servers, and FTP servers, all interconnected using international standard cable architecture.

## Project Key Points

### Simulated Devices
- **Switches:** These devices are used to connect multiple devices within the network and facilitate communication between them.
- **Routers:** Routers are responsible for routing data packets between different networks, ensuring efficient data transmission.
- **Email Server:** An email server is set up to handle email communication within the university network.
- **FTP Server:** An FTP server is established for file-sharing purposes within the network.

## How to Run the Project on Your Computer

To run this project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer Software:**
   Ensure that you have Cisco Packet Tracer software installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the [official Cisco website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) or through authorized distributors.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the project files directly from the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/kosaladeshan/University-Network>

   ```
3. **Open the Project:**
Navigate to the project directory and open the project file named "02 Activity.pkt" using Cisco Packet Tracer.

4. **Explore the Simulation:**
Once the project is opened in Cisco Packet Tracer, you can explore the network simulation. Interact with the devices and observe the network operations.

5. **Refer to README for Details:**
The README file within the project contains additional information and instructions specific to the network simulation. Make sure to review it for a better understanding of the project setup and configuration.

By following these steps, you can effectively run the University Network Simulation Project on your computer using Cisco Packet Tracer software.
